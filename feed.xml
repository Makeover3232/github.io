                <p>Our SOC doesn’t just respond to alerts; we invest in proactive detection engineering and threat hunting to stay ahead of adversaries. Default rules are a good starting <strong>point</strong>, but without refinement, they often generate noise or miss key attack patterns.</p>
<p>As our client base has grown, we have focused on building repeatable and well-documented detection content. This ensures high-confidence alerts, stronger workflows for analysts, and a clear path for maturing our operations.</p>
<p>Over the past quarter, I developed a set of "one-pager" documents to capture and share our most valuable custom detections and hunting queries in Microsoft Sentinel. Each one includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The KQL query</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use case description</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MITRE ATT&amp;CK mapping</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SOC workflow impact</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Visuals or screenshots where useful</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>This framework has reduced time-to-value for new detections and empowered our SOC team to scale smarter.</strong></p>

                <p>Here is a slightly revised version incorporating those suggestions. It keeps your excellent core message but refines the wording for maximum impact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As our SOC team scaled, our reactive approach to scheduling analyst time became a significant bottleneck. Without a data-driven way to measure demand, allocating resources for projects, meetings, and professional development was inefficient and created a risk of analyst burnout.</p>
<p>To solve this, I designed and built a utilisation model that combines:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alert volumes enriched with a “level of human triage required” filter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incident escalations mapped by hour and day</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Effort metrics based on actual triage, escalation, and remediation data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A heatmap visualisation to highlight peaks and quieter periods</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The result was a clear, actionable picture of workload patterns and peak demand windows.</strong> This data now informs our strategic resourcing, strengthens our pricing models, and helps us structure the SOC to better serve our clients.</p>

                <p>One of the biggest sources of noise in our SOC is “impossible travel” detections. Too many false positives, and analysts stop trusting the alerts, wasting valuable time triaging benign activity. Too much suppression, and you risk missing real anomalies.</p>

<p>With a major new government client, we needed to strike the right balance and address the reality that HR and policy rarely move at the speed required for a high-paced SOC. While we have been working with this and other key customers to uplift their travel and remote work policies, we have also invested heavily in noise reduction. This has freed up SOC capacity for higher-value tasks such as threat hunting, detection engineering, and maturing our advisory and IOC mapping practices.</p>
<p>Over the past few months I have refined this use case in Microsoft Sentinel through:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Custom UEBA-style logic to highlight true anomalies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trusted-device and service exclusions to cut high-confidence false positives</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A known overseas-user watchlist for targeted suppression of expected travel and VPN usage</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An investigation automation (Logic Apps) that collects key incident data, converts it into user-friendly strings, and emails both the user and their manager with next steps</p>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>The result: less noise, clearer signals, and faster responses for the alerts that matter.</em></strong></p>
